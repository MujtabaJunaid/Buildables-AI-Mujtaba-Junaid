Without it, each user input would be treated as an isolated query, making the interaction feel broken and frustrating.\n",

    "Beginners should always check API limits and pricing to avoid unexpected charges and to understand the constraints of the service they are building on. This prevents their application from failing or incurring high costs once it moves beyond a simple prototype."

    "1) Stemming:\n",
    "    - Cuts off word endings to get the ‚Äúroot.‚Äù\n",
    "    - Very mechanical ‚Üí may produce non-real words.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - \"studies\" ‚Üí \"studi\"\n",
    "        - \"running\" ‚Üí \"run\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Lemmatization:\n",
    "    - Smarter ‚Üí uses vocabulary + grammar rules.\n",
    "    - Always gives a real word (the **lemma**).\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - \"studies\" ‚Üí \"study\"\n",
    "        - \"running\" ‚Üí \"run\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging means labeling each word in a sentence with its grammatical role ‚Äî like **noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - Sentence ‚Üí *‚ÄúThe cat is sleeping on the mat.‚Äù*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - POS tags ‚Üí\n",
    "        - The ‚Üí Determiner (DT)\n",
    "        - cat ‚Üí Noun (NN)\n",
    "        - is ‚Üí Verb (VBZ)\n",
    "        - sleeping ‚Üí Verb (VBG)\n",
    "        - on ‚Üí Preposition (IN)\n",
