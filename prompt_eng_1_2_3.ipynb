    "Refined Prompt: “Write a 150-word introduction to space for middle school students, explaining stars, planets, and galaxies in a simple way.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Space is the huge area outside our planet where stars, planets, and galaxies exist. Stars are like giant glowing balls of gas that give off light and heat, like our Sun. Planets are big round objects that travel around stars. Earth, where we live, is one of them. Galaxies are giant collections of billions of stars, planets, and dust, all held together by gravity. Our galaxy is called the Milky Way. Space is so big that scientists use telescopes and spacecraft to study it.

    "\n",
    "Answer: History is the study of past events, people, and societies. It helps us understand how the world has changed and why things are the way they are today. By studying history, students learn about successes, mistakes, and lessons from the past. This knowledge helps us make better decisions in the present and future. It also teaches critical thinking and empathy by showing how different people lived in different times. Learning history is important because it connects us to our roots, builds awareness of cultures, and helps us become informed citizens."

German Shepherds are strong, smart dogs with pointy ears and black-and-tan fur. They are often used as police dogs because they learn quickly. Poodles come in different sizes, with curly fur that doesn’t shed much. They are very intelligent and easy to train.

    "Improved Prompt: “Explain photosynthesis in 120 words for high school students, focusing on how plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to make food.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food. Using sunlight, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Inside their leaves, a green substance called chlorophyll helps capture sunlight. With this energy, the plant changes carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a type of sugar that gives the plant energy to grow. Oxygen is also made during this process and released into the air. Photosynthesis is important because it provides food for plants and oxygen for humans and animals.\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer: Climate change is when Earth’s temperature rises because of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. These gases trap heat, mostly from burning fuels in cars, factories, and homes. As the planet warms, we see stronger storms, rising seas, and melting ice. To help, people can save energy, recycle, plant trees, and use public transport instead of cars. Small changes by many people make a big difference in protecting our planet for future generations."

    "Answer: Recycling is the process of turning old or used materials into something new instead of throwing them away. It helps reduce waste, saves natural resources, and lowers pollution. For example, recycling paper saves trees, and recycling plastic keeps it out of oceans. Teenagers can make a big difference by recycling at home and school. At home, sort items like paper, glass, and cans into recycling bins. At school, use recycling stations and encourage classmates to join.

His family hugged him tightly, thankful to the friends who had helped. Max learned that kindness can be found everywhere. The story teaches that teamwork and friendship can help overcome challenges."
